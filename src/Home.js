  <h2> Psytrance or Psychedelic Trance is a kind of electronic dance music (EDM), more specifically it’s a subgenre of trance music.

The term Psychedelic is coined by English psychiatrist Humphry Osmond, derived from Ancient Greek psukhḗ (mind or soul) and dêlos (to reveal, to manifest) to signify “Mind-manifesting“.

Psytrance is characterized by arrangements of rhythms, layered melodies created by high tempo riffs and a very distinctive bass.

The combination of these hypnotic, pulsing melodies and rhythms aim to guide dancers in replicating or enhancing the psychedelic experience; the alternated state of consciousness of experiencing a collective state of bodily transcendence, similar to that of ancient shamanic dancing rituals.</h2>
